## Seasons
This is a React application built to better understand the differences between functional components, class based components, states and lifecycle events.

## Whats going on in there?

It's an application that is going to detect what season the user is currently experiencing outside in their physical environment.

### For example:
If the user is located in the northern hemisphere that means we have to actually detect our users physical location when they visit our application.

If they're in the northern hemisphere and it's between October and March then it's probably going
to be winter. If it's winter, something like Bur. it's chilly should print on the screen and show some snowflake icons.

### A quick recap...

The app is detecting what season it is based on the user's location and their current time or what month it is.

Once needed data is obtained by the app, it will print some different content on the screen based upon the user's geographic position.
